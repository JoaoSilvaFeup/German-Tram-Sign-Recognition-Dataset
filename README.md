# German Tram Sign Recognition Dataset

## Overview

Within the scope of the dissertation "Environment Detection for Railway Applications based on Automotive Technology", a new dataset was created in order to tackle the major lack of publicly available options for Railway Sign Recognition. 

The novel collection comprises both detection and classification, with the annotations devised for the two partitions being present in this repository.

This README aims at explaining how one can download the footage used for the dataset, extracted from [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXu4ZCM9_2LyYf7cVcswrJfHWGpOGcLfG), and take advantage of the annotations here at hand.

Overall, the resources here made available are:

* A compiled list of all German Tram Signs, along with some additional properties;
* A compiled list of the German Tram Signs labelled for the dataset;
* 10 JSON files created for the videos used for Traffic Sign Detection (one file for each video);
* 1 JSON file containing all labels from the ROIs extracted from the Detection partition, used for Classification;
* The MATLAB Labelling Sessions created to annotate the Detection Partition, using the Video Labeler Tool;
* The MATLAB script used to downsample the videos;
* The SVGs manually devised in Inkscape to be used as ideal signs, upon being converted to PNGs.
