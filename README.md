# German Tram Sign Recognition Dataset

## Overview

Within the scope of the dissertation "Environment Detection for Railway Applications based on Automotive Technology", a new dataset was created in order to tackle the major lack of publicly available options for Railway Sign Recognition. 

The novel collection comprises both detection and classification, with the annotations devised for the two partitions being present in this repository.

This README aims at explaining how one can download the footage used for the dataset, extracted from [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXu4ZCM9_2LyYf7cVcswrJfHWGpOGcLfG)
, and take advantage of the annotations here at hand.
